# Ripple Surface — History

**Stable surface ID:** `history`
**Surface contract version:** 1.2.1
**Last verified:** 2026-09-23
**Kind:** Root screen
**Localized name:** `Verlauf` / `History`

This is the canonical description of the month-based History surface.

## Purpose and user outcome

The user understands hydration by day across a calendar month and can open an
allowed day for entry-level detail. History is activity-oriented and is not a
recent-entry feed or a Stats replacement.

## Entry and exit

History opens from root navigation. Month navigation stays on this surface.
Selecting today or a past day opens [`day-detail.md`](day-detail.md). Future
days are visible but inactive. The surface does not edit data directly.

## Layout and region order

1. Month/date navigation and localized month title.
2. Weekday labels.
3. A month grid with one capped progress ring or equivalent day marker per
   calendar day.
4. A legend or summary explaining goal status and the selected day.
5. Platform root navigation outside the feature content.

The calendar is the primary content. A regular or expanded presentation may
reserve a persistent detail region after a day is selected, but the semantic
route remains History → Day Detail.

## Reference evidence and visible-element inventory

**Reference set:** [iPhone History](ios/iphone-history.png), [Android phone History](../Android/UI/phone-history.png), [Android tablet split](../Android/UI/tablet-history-split.png), and [shared compact/expanded/adaptive wireframes](../wireframes/history--ready--compact.png)
**Reference classification:** Current compact iOS target plus Android compact/expanded supporting evidence and shared semantic wireframes.
**States/viewports inspected:** Populated month compact, selected-day expanded split, constrained-height, and active-fold regions.
**System-owned chrome excluded from the shared wireframe:** Status bars, device frames, iOS/Android root navigation, and native split/rail chrome.

**Required product-owned composition:** Today-only plus action; month title and previous/next context; weekday row; one date/ring marker per calendar day with future-disabled and selected states; selected-day context; calendar/detail regions above the documented width threshold.

The complete element-by-element inventory, reference identity, crop/state notes,
and reconciliation decisions are maintained in the [Ripple visual reference
inventory](../Ripple_VISUAL_REFERENCE_INVENTORY.md#history). The linked
review note is part of this surface contract; it does not authorize behavior
outside the PRD or replace the native platform mapping.

## Platform-independent wireframes

![History ready-state compact wireframe: month navigation, one day ring per date, and selected day context](../wireframes/history--ready--compact.png)

Editable source: [history--ready--compact.svg](../wireframes/history--ready--compact.svg).

Caption: Representative ready state in the compact semantic viewport; shared surface contract version 1.2.1. The neutral illustration shows hierarchy only and does not prescribe native navigation or control appearance.

![History ready-state expanded wireframe: calendar beside the selected day detail region](../wireframes/history--ready--expanded.png)

Editable source: [history--ready--expanded.svg](../wireframes/history--ready--expanded.svg).

Caption: Representative ready state in the expanded semantic viewport; shared surface contract version 1.2.1. The neutral illustration shows hierarchy only and does not prescribe native navigation or control appearance.


![History responsive wireframe showing usable regions and retained state](../wireframes/history--resize--adaptive.png)

Editable source: [history--resize--adaptive.svg](../wireframes/history--resize--adaptive.svg).
Caption: Neutral resize/fold illustration, surface contract 1.2.1; not runtime evidence.
The earlier ready-state images remain representative baseline hierarchy references.

## Read model

Use `HistorySnapshot` for the requested local calendar month, with one
`DayTotal` per day and the entries needed when a day is selected. A day total
contains consumed amount, goal context, percentage, and status. Future days
are identified from the current local date, not from a server timestamp.

## Actions and domain operations

| User action | Operation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Change month | `ObserveMonth` | Replace the month snapshot and announce the new localized month. |
| Select today or a past day | `ObserveHistory` for the selected day / open `day-detail` | Preserve date context and show the day detail surface. |
| Select a future day | None | Keep the calendar unchanged and announce that the day is unavailable. |
| Change root section | Platform-local navigation | Preserve the current month selection where lifecycle permits. |

## States

- **Loading:** Keep month header and calendar frame stable and announce loading.
- **Empty month:** Render every calendar day with zero progress and useful
  empty copy; do not invent bars or rings.
- **Ready:** Render one marker per day, capped at 100 percent.
- **Future:** Disable and do not activate future days.
- **Offline/sync unavailable:** Keep cached local data readable and show status
  inline.
- **Error:** Explain the unavailable month and provide retry.
- **Reduced motion:** Avoid ring-spin or calendar-introduction choreography.

## Validation and destructive behavior

No future day is actionable. History does not edit, delete, or create entries.
All mutations belong to Day Detail or Edit Intake. Progress is visualized as a
cap, but actual consumed values remain available to detail and accessibility.

## Accessibility and large text

Each day announces localized date, consumed amount, goal, percentage, and goal
status. Future days announce unavailable. Calendar reading order is
chronological; changing month announces the new month. The ring/marker is never
the only indication of progress. Large text may enlarge day cells or reflow
the legend but may not remove date or amount information.

## Design tokens and reusable elements

Use `DayHeader`, `DayRing`, `GlassCard`, `EmptyState`, and `SyncStatusView`.
All colors, type, spacing, shapes, and motion come from
[`../Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

## Responsive/platform-independent behavior

Use the current usable container width, including during resizing and folding.
Show calendar and detail side by side only when each has at least 320 logical
units plus the 1-unit divider (641 total); below that, show a single calendar
and nested detail. In a short container the month content can scroll vertically
without replacing horizontal month paging. During an active fold use the
system-provided regions for calendar and detail. Preserve the visible month,
selected day, open detail, and open custom-amount sheet and draft when the
presentation expands or collapses. A previously opened detail remains the
same day after the transition. Wearable History is a separate seven-day
surface and never becomes a month grid through scaling.

## Forbidden behavior

- A recent-entry list as the primary History surface.
- A GitHub-style heatmap or three fitness rings.
- A combined History and Stats destination.
- Tappable future days.
- Chart or day-total truth sourced from a projection instead of the domain.

## Timeline

| Version | Date | Change | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 2026-09-11 | Established the canonical platform-independent History description. | iOS and Android share one semantic surface outcome and action boundary. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-09-18 | Added the shared ready-state wireframes and verified the contract against the Apple 1.1 baseline. | Android receives a current neutral layout reference without replacing native controls or runtime evidence. |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-09-19 | Specified container-driven resize/fold composition and preserved presentation state; added an adaptive wireframe. | Compact and expanded windows retain usable content and ongoing interaction. |

| 1.2.1 | 2026-09-23 | Added the visible-element inventory and restored the today-only add affordance in the compact and expanded shared wireframes. | History references now preserve the calendar, selected-day context, add action, and responsive region relationship. |

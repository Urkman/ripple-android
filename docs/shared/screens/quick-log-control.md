# Ripple Surface — Quick-log control

**Stable surface ID:** `quick-log-control`
**Surface contract version:** 1.1.1
**Last verified:** 2026-09-23
**Kind:** System surface
**Localized name:** Platform-local control name

This is the canonical contract for a focused operating-system quick-log
control.

## Purpose and user outcome

The user logs one focused predefined amount from a system control without
opening the full app.

## Entry and exit

The system invokes the control adapter. The adapter resolves the configured
default/container amount through shared domain policy, calls `LogIntake`, and
returns a concise success/error result to the system surface. More complex
selection opens the app's custom amount surface when supported.

## Layout and region order

The system controls the host chrome. Ripple supplies only the localized action
label, amount/container meaning, state/result, and optional focused icon.

## Reference evidence and visible-element inventory

**Reference set:** [shared quick-log wireframe](../wireframes/quick-log-control--ready--compact.png); no runtime capture is currently designated
**Reference classification:** Current shared system-entry illustration.
**States/viewports inspected:** Ready, unavailable amount, success, and independent projection failure.
**System-owned chrome excluded from the shared wireframe:** Host control placement, focus, hit-target treatment, and system interaction.

**Required product-owned composition:** One focused action name; resolved positive amount/unit; source meaning; success/error result; no dashboard or second write path.

The complete element-by-element inventory, reference identity, crop/state notes,
and reconciliation decisions are maintained in the [Ripple visual reference
inventory](../Ripple_VISUAL_REFERENCE_INVENTORY.md#quick-log-control). The linked
review note is part of this surface contract; it does not authorize behavior
outside the PRD or replace the native platform mapping.

## Platform-independent wireframes

## Read model

Read the current effective default or explicitly configured quick amount.

## Actions and domain operations

The only mutation is `LogIntake` with source `control`. A local store/projection
failure is reported independently; the control must not create a second log
path.

## States

The action is unavailable when no valid positive amount can be resolved. Ready
shows the amount/unit. Success reports the stored amount. Permission or sync
failure does not erase or roll back a stored local log. Reduced motion is
irrelevant to the static control result.

## Validation and destructive behavior

The resolved amount must be positive and valid for the current unit/default
policy. The control has no destructive action.

## Accessibility and large text

The system control announces action, amount, unit, and result. Its host may
change size or placement; the semantic action remains one focused log.

## Design tokens and reusable elements

Use the shared amount, icon, label, and accessibility roles from
[`../Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md). Preserve the
operating system's control, focus, hit target, and permission behavior.

## Responsive/platform-independent behavior

The host may change size, placement, or invocation gesture; the action remains
one focused log with an amount and unit.

## Forbidden behavior

- Duplicate amount logic in the control adapter.
- Direct storage writes outside `LogIntake`.
- A hidden or ambiguous default amount.
- A full dashboard, calendar, or Stats chart in the control.

## Timeline

| Version | Date | Change | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 2026-09-11 | Established the canonical platform-independent Quick-log control description. | iOS and Android share one semantic surface outcome and action boundary. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-09-18 | Added the shared ready-state wireframe and verified the contract against the Apple 1.1 baseline. | Android receives a current neutral layout reference without replacing native controls or runtime evidence. |

| 1.1.1 | 2026-09-23 | Added current-reference classification and a linked visible-element inventory for this surface. | Product-owned regions, state/viewport coverage, and system-chrome exclusions are traceable for the cross-platform handoff. |

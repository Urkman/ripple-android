# Ripple Surface — Edit intake

**Stable surface ID:** `edit-intake`
**Surface contract version:** 1.1.1
**Last verified:** 2026-09-23
**Kind:** Sheet
**Localized name:** `Eintrag bearbeiten` / `Edit intake`

This is the canonical description of editing one existing intake.

## Purpose and user outcome

The user can correct the amount or permitted metadata of one existing intake
without creating a second intake or changing the selected day implicitly.

## Entry and exit

The sheet opens from an intake row in Day Detail. Cancel, back, or dismissal
returns unchanged. Save calls `EditIntake` and returns to Day Detail after
successful persistence. Delete belongs to Day Detail, not this sheet.

## Layout and region order

1. Selected date/time and entry context.
2. Amount control and current amount readout.
3. Optional supported container, beverage, or note fields.
4. Inline validation message when required.
5. Cancel and primary Save actions.

Labels precede values. The original entry identity and relevant context remain
visible while the draft is edited.

## Reference evidence and visible-element inventory

**Reference set:** [shared edit-intake wireframe](../wireframes/edit-intake--ready--compact.png); no runtime capture is currently designated
**Reference classification:** Current shared semantic wireframe.
**States/viewports inspected:** Ready compact, invalid, save-error, and large-text reflow.
**System-owned chrome excluded from the shared wireframe:** Native sheet, keyboard, picker, and dismissal chrome.

**Required product-owned composition:** Entry date/time and identity context; amount/unit; supported container or metadata fields; field-associated validation; Cancel and primary Save.

The complete element-by-element inventory, reference identity, crop/state notes,
and reconciliation decisions are maintained in the [Ripple visual reference
inventory](../Ripple_VISUAL_REFERENCE_INVENTORY.md#edit-intake). The linked
review note is part of this surface contract; it does not authorize behavior
outside the PRD or replace the native platform mapping.

## Platform-independent wireframes

Editable source: [edit-intake--ready--compact.svg](../wireframes/edit-intake--ready--compact.svg).

Caption: Representative ready state in the compact semantic viewport; shared surface contract version 1.1.1. The neutral illustration shows hierarchy only and does not prescribe native navigation or control appearance.


## Read model and draft

Read the selected `Intake`, available containers, preferred unit, locale, and
the allowed editable fields. Maintain a local draft separate from persistence.
The draft carries the original stable intake ID and may not silently change its
date or source unless the product contract explicitly permits that field.

## Actions and domain operations

| User action | Operation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Adjust an editable field | Local draft update | Update the readout and validation state without writing. |
| Save valid draft | `EditIntake` | Update the original row, refresh the Day Detail total, and dismiss. |
| Cancel/dismiss | None | Discard the draft and leave the original intake unchanged. |
| Retry a failed save | `EditIntake` again | Preserve the draft and report the new result. |

## States

- **Loading:** Keep the selected entry context visible while fields resolve.
- **Ready:** Show the original values and enabled editable controls.
- **Invalid:** Keep Save disabled and explain the exact correction required.
- **Offline/sync unavailable:** Permit local persistence if the domain store is
  available; report projection status separately.
- **Error:** Retain the unsaved draft and offer retry.
- **Success:** Update Day Detail and dismiss without a duplicate row.
- **Reduced motion:** Avoid decorative sheet transitions.

## Validation and destructive behavior

Amounts must be positive integer milliliters after deterministic conversion.
Text and metadata follow the data model's allowed ranges. Save updates the
original identity and timestamps according to the use case. Cancel is
non-destructive; deleting is not available here.

## Accessibility and large text

The amount control announces current value and unit. Every field has a clear
label, validation text is associated with its field, and Save announces that it
updates an existing entry. Focus begins at the context/title and ends at the
primary action. Large text may grow the sheet but must not hide Save.

## Design tokens and reusable elements

Use the same amount-control, field, card, type, spacing, and native-control
tokens as [`custom-amount.md`](custom-amount.md), with `RippleToast` only for
the resulting status where needed. Do not create an editor-only visual system.

## Responsive/platform-independent behavior

The surface may be a bottom-attached, centered, or side-aligned modal. Fields
may reflow vertically on compact displays and use a wider two-region layout on
expanded displays while preserving context → fields → validation → actions.

## Forbidden behavior

- Saving by inserting a new intake.
- Mutating persistence while merely changing a draft control.
- Hiding the original date/time context.
- Deleting from this sheet without the Day Detail destructive contract.
- Using a projection as the source of the editable value.

## Timeline

| Version | Date | Change | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 2026-09-11 | Established the canonical platform-independent Edit intake description. | iOS and Android share one semantic surface outcome and action boundary. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-09-18 | Added the shared ready-state wireframe and verified the contract against the Apple 1.1 baseline. | Android receives a current neutral layout reference without replacing native controls or runtime evidence. |

| 1.1.1 | 2026-09-23 | Added current-reference classification and a linked visible-element inventory for this surface. | Product-owned regions, state/viewport coverage, and system-chrome exclusions are traceable for the cross-platform handoff. |

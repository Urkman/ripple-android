# Ripple iOS Architecture

Ripple is a Swift 6, SwiftUI-first hydration app built as a feature-first Clean MVVM system. The same domain write API serves the main apps, widgets, Siri/App Intents, notification actions, and watch surfaces. SwiftData is the source of truth; CloudKit synchronizes the shared private store when the platform is configured for it, and HealthKit is an optional projection.

This document describes the iOS repository's architecture and current implementation. Product behavior remains defined by the shared [PRD](Ripple_PRD.md), including its consolidated Today, History, Stats, and motion contracts. The platform-independent surface, design, and data contracts are maintained in the [screen catalog](Ripple_SCREEN_CATALOG.md), [design system](Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md), and [data model](Ripple_DATA_MODEL.md); this document maps those contracts to Swift implementation boundaries without redefining them.

**Document version:** 1.13.0

**Reference release baseline:** Apple marketing version 1.1 — 2026-09-17

## 1. Architectural goals and invariants

Ripple is organized around a small set of invariants:

- Every intake is created by `LogIntake.run(amount:source:date:)`.
- All persisted amounts are integer milliliters. Unit conversion is a presentation concern.
- SwiftData writes happen through the `@ModelActor`-isolated store. Views never mutate models directly.
- SwiftData is the source of truth. HealthKit, widgets, reminders, and UI snapshots are projections or consumers.
- Deletion is a soft delete using `isDeleted`; restore and undo are explicit use cases.
- Undo means `UndoLastIntake` for the last own, non-deleted intake. There is no distributed undo stack.
- View models orchestrate domain use cases but do not contain persistence, CloudKit, HealthKit, or notification code.
- Navigation is platform-local to each app target. The iOS composition root may
  own an app-wide typed router for iOS destinations; other Apple targets retain
  their own native navigation state.
- Product invariants are shared through `Docs/shared/Ripple_PRD.md`; implementation and persistence remain platform-local. Platform conditionals belong in apps, UI adapters, or composition code.
- The UI uses the tokens and reusable components from `RippleUI`; features do not define parallel colors, typography, or motion systems.

## 2. System at a glance

The repository is split into package layers. Apps and extensions are composition roots: they assemble dependencies, provide scenes, and own platform-specific root shells, but do not own business logic.

```text
 Apps + Extensions

        +--------------------+----------------------+------------------+

                   |
             RippleDomain
        entities, ports, use cases

 RippleUI is shared by app features, intents-facing surfaces, widgets,
 and watch UI. It owns tokens, reusable components, and motion primitives.
```

### Package dependency graph

| Package | Depends on | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RippleDomain` | None | Sendable entities, value types, ports, use cases, calculations, formatters |
| `RippleData` | `RippleDomain` | SwiftData models/store, CloudKit-compatible configuration, HealthKit projection, notifications, widget reloads |
| `RippleIntentsCore` | `RippleDomain` | App Intents, entities, shortcuts, and system-entry adapters |
| `RippleUI` | None; Core Motion on supported platforms | Design tokens, reusable controls, hero water geometry, motion, widgets, watch components |
| `RippleFeatures` | `RippleDomain`, `RippleUI` | Reusable screen views and `@Observable` view models; it does not contain executable platform root shells |

The apps link the packages together. `RippleFeatures` intentionally does not depend on `RippleData`; the app composition root injects the domain use cases into reusable feature screens and owns the iOS app-wide route state plus the platform-local root navigation shell.

Xcode project generation is defined in [`project.yml`](../../project.yml). Package manifests and application targets use Swift 6 and 27.0 deployment targets for iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. This permits direct use of SDK 27 APIs; tvOS remains an explicit exception where SwiftUI does not expose a given API, such as `.reorderable()`.

## 4. Composition roots and dependency injection

### Startup sequence

Each executable starts the shared data bootstrap before presenting its root view:

```text
 App or extension starts
          |
          v
 RippleBootstrap.start(inMemory: ...)
          |
          +--> register notification categories
          +--> create SharedContainer / ModelContainer
          +--> create RippleStore (@ModelActor)
          +--> create repository adapters and system adapters
          +--> UseCases.assemble(...)
          +--> install process-local RippleRuntime bridge
          +--> seed default settings asynchronously
          |
          v
 Inject UseCases into SwiftUI environment or system adapter
```

`RippleContainer` is the composition object. It holds the shared model container, `RippleStore`, sync status store, and assembled `UseCases` value. `UseCases.assemble(...)` is the domain-level factory that wires repository and port implementations without exposing concrete data types to features.

SwiftUI screens receive use cases through the `rippleUseCases` environment key. A view model retains the injected `UseCases` value and calls it asynchronously. Widgets, notification actions, and App Intents do not have a SwiftUI environment, so `RippleRuntime` provides a process-local bridge to the already assembled use cases. It is an entry-point bridge, not a second persistence layer or second business implementation.

Previews and package tests use the same domain interfaces with in-memory repositories and no-op system adapters. The debug demo scenario also goes through use cases; it does not insert records directly.

## 5. Domain layer

`RippleDomain` is framework-independent. It does not import SwiftUI, SwiftData, CloudKit, HealthKit, WidgetKit, or platform UI frameworks.

### Domain entities and value types

The main domain values include:

- `Intake`: UUID, local date, integer `amountMl`, beverage, source, optional container, note, timestamps, and soft-delete state.
- `Container`: reusable amount/name/symbol/default/sort information.
- `Profile`: preferred unit, body mass, activity level, wake/sleep schedule, reminder and health preferences, haptics, and onboarding state.
- `GoalSettings`: manual or calculated goal mode.
- `TodaySnapshot`, `DaySummary`, `HistorySnapshot`, and `StatsSnapshot`: read models shaped for feature screens.
- `IntakeSource`: app, widget, watch, Siri, control, notification, and other system entry points.
- `SyncStatus`, authorization statuses, reminder rules, export payloads, units, clock times, and period/range types.

These values are small, Sendable types. IDs are stable UUIDs so records, HealthKit projections, intents, and CloudKit merges can refer to the same logical object.

### Ports

The domain depends on protocols rather than data frameworks:

- `IntakeRepository` reads and writes intake data and derived range/stat queries.
- `SettingsRepository` reads and writes profile, goals, containers, reminder rules, and sync state.
- `HealthProjecting`, `HealthAuthorizing`, and `WorkoutReading` describe HealthKit capabilities.
- `ReminderScheduling` and `NotificationAuthorizing` describe notification behavior.
- `WidgetReloading` tells system surfaces to refresh after a write.

This keeps use cases testable and makes the same rules usable by the iOS app, watch app, widgets, and intents.

### Use cases

Write use cases are the only supported write API for features and system surfaces:

`LogIntake`, `UndoLastIntake`, `EditIntake`, `DeleteIntake`, `RestoreIntake`, `UpdateGoal`, `UpdateProfile`, `UpsertContainer`, `DeleteContainer`, `RescheduleReminders`, and the authorization requests.

Read use cases provide feature-shaped observations:

`ObserveToday`, `ObserveHistory`, `ObserveMonth`, `ObserveStats`, and `CalculateGoal`.

`ExportData` is the explicit export path for user data. The export boundary is important because the store uses soft deletion and does not provide a hard-wipe shortcut.

### Goal calculation and aggregation

Goal calculation is centralized in `CalculateGoal`. The current calculation uses manual goals when selected; otherwise it derives a weight-based baseline, applies the configured activity/workout adjustment, and enforces the domain minimum. Historical days use a stable fallback goal rather than silently changing old summaries when today's settings change.

History aggregation creates a day summary for every day in the requested range, including empty days, excludes soft-deleted intakes, caps visual progress at 1.0, and marks whether the goal was reached. Stats aggregation derives period totals, averages, hit/empty/weak days, day-part and container breakdowns, best day, and current hit run.

## 6. The single intake write path

Every intake-producing surface eventually follows the same path:

```text
 Button / widget / Watch / Siri / Control / notification
                         |
                         v
                  source-specific adapter
                         |
                         v
              LogIntake.run(amount:source:date:)
                         |
                         +--> validate and normalize integer ml
                         +--> create Intake UUID
                         +--> repository.save(intake)
                         +--> best-effort HealthKit projection
                         +--> widget timeline reload
                         +--> reminder rescheduling
                         |
                         v
                   updated SwiftData store
```

`LogIntake` saves the domain intake before attempting projections. A HealthKit or notification failure does not roll back the saved intake. Widget-originated writes avoid an unnecessary self-reload while still using the same use case and store.

The app's rapid taps are coalesced only at the presentation/motion level: each tap remains a separate store row, while `TodayViewModel` presents one continuous pour series. This preserves data fidelity without creating a second batch-write path.

Undo, edit, delete, and restore are separate use cases. They update the same record identity and coordinate the corresponding HealthKit projection/retraction, widget reload, and reminder refresh. Deletion never removes the SwiftData object physically.

## 7. Persistence and synchronization

### SwiftData schema

`RippleData` defines a CloudKit-compatible schema consisting of:

- `IntakeRecord`
- `ContainerRecord`
- `GoalSettingsRecord`
- `ProfileRecord`
- `ReminderRuleRecord`

Records store primitive values and raw enum strings. The schema avoids relationships and uniqueness constraints that complicate CloudKit-backed SwiftData stores. Domain-to-record conversion is isolated in `RecordMapping.swift`.

### Store actor boundary

`RippleStore` is a `@ModelActor` actor. It owns the `ModelContext`, performs fetches and saves, maps records to domain values, and applies soft-delete/update rules. Repositories delegate persistence work to this actor; features never receive a model context.

Reads made by extensions use a fresh read facade over the same shared model container. This allows a widget or intent process to observe data written by another process instead of relying on an in-memory snapshot.

### Shared container and fallback behavior

`SharedContainer` resolves storage in this order:

1. App Group container with automatic CloudKit configuration when the shared group is available.
2. App Group local storage without CloudKit.
3. App-local disk storage without CloudKit.
4. In-memory storage as a final fallback.

The configured identifiers are `group.de.stefansturm.ripple` and `iCloud.de.stefansturm.ripple`, with Info.plist overrides supported. The migration path can adopt a legacy local store into the App Group store and merges records by UUID and update time.

CloudKit synchronization is therefore an implementation of the shared store, not a separate domain source of truth. The app can report unavailable/degraded sync status while continuing to log locally.

### Conflict and deletion rules

- Intake identity is the UUID; append-only intake creation is safe to merge.
- Soft-deleted intakes remain available for sync, restore, export, and projection reconciliation.
- Settings records use update timestamps for last-writer handling.
- No view writes through `@Query`; queries are read-only UI observations where used.
- UserDefaults is not used as a second intake or settings database. Ephemeral widget state is not authoritative.

The persistence and layering rules are maintained in this document and the
authoritative product contract. There is no separate decision-record tree.

## 8. HealthKit and other projections

HealthKit is optional and never authoritative. When authorized, a successful intake is projected to Dietary Water in liters with the intake UUID and source stored as metadata. The projection layer deduplicates by UUID, and delete/undo retracts the projected sample when possible.

Health authorization is split by purpose:

- onboarding/write access for dietary water;
- read access for body mass;
- optional workout reads used by goal calculation.

Projection errors are logged/contained at the adapter boundary. The SwiftData
intake remains valid if HealthKit is unavailable, denied, or temporarily fails.
This behavior is part of the shared architecture and product contract.

Notifications are also adapters. `NotificationAuthorizer` translates system authorization status, while `ReminderScheduler` owns categories, pending-request replacement, wake/sleep bounds, interval calculation, and the default log action. The notification action invokes the same `LogIntake` use case rather than creating a notification-specific write path.

The current release scheduler removes the previous pending request before each
reschedule, checks the current authorization status without requesting
permission, schedules at most the next actionable notification inside the
configured local window, and quietly cancels when reminders are disabled or
authorization is unavailable. Scheduling/projection failure never removes a
locally persisted intake.

## 9. Feature layer and MVVM

`RippleFeatures` is a UI orchestration layer. Each view model is `@MainActor @Observable`, stores the injected use cases as an ignored observation dependency, and exposes plain state for views. Platform executable targets own their root shell files; those shells compose these reusable feature views and models without moving business rules into the app targets.

- `TodayViewModel`: observes today's snapshot, logs app intakes, coalesces rapid additions for hero motion, and invokes undo.
- `HistoryViewModel`: loads month summaries, computes calendar slots, prevents future-day selection, and drives day-detail navigation.
- `DayDetailViewModel`: observes a selected day and manages edit/delete/restore plus today's add affordance.
- `StatsViewModel`: selects week/month/year periods, loads chart data, groups day parts/containers, and formats summary values.
- `SettingsViewModel`: edits profile, goals, containers, reminders, sync/health authorization, and export.
- `OnboardingViewModel`: coordinates the staged profile, health, notification, and goal setup flow.
- Watch-specific models: `WatchTodayViewModel`, `WatchHistoryViewModel`, `WatchDayDetailViewModel`, and `WatchStatsViewModel` adapt the same use cases to the Watch interaction model.

The current Today hierarchy intentionally has no Recent or last-entry list;
History and Day Detail own entry inspection. Onboarding is six pages in this
order: Welcome, Units, Health permission, Goal, Containers, and Reminders.

The environment provides use cases and a small amount of layout configuration. It does not provide a data store or a cross-platform router; the iOS composition root passes typed navigation bindings and actions into feature views.

The iOS composition root owns `RippleNavigationCoordinator`, an
`@MainActor @Observable` app-wide router for the iOS target. Its typed route
state owns root-section selection, the compact History path, custom-amount
presentation, and Settings presentation routes. Feature views remain in
`RippleFeatures`; they receive narrow bindings/actions and render the
destination or sheet content without importing the app target. The router does
not cross platform boundaries or replace the native root navigation shells on
watchOS, macOS, tvOS, or visionOS.

### Screen structure

On iPhone and iPad, `RootView` provides four tabs:

1. Today
2. History
3. Stats
4. Settings

History and Stats are deliberately separate products. History is a month activity calendar with one ring per day and a day detail. Stats is a period summary with Swift Charts. iPad uses split layouts where appropriate instead of shrinking the iPhone hierarchy.

Platform roots are local to each app target. The root shell is not compiled as part of the multiplatform `RippleFeatures` target:

- iOS (`Apps/RippleiOS/RootView.swift`, `RippleNavigationCoordinator.swift`): app-wide typed routing for the four tabs, compact History → Day Detail, and root-owned presentations, with iPad split rendering preserved by the History feature.
- watchOS (`Apps/RipplewatchOS/WatchRootView.swift`): horizontal Today, History, and Stats pages.
- macOS (`Apps/RipplemacOS/MacRootView.swift`): `NavigationSplitView` sidebar with keyboard commands and menu-bar composition.
- tvOS (`Apps/RippletvOS/TVRootView.swift`): minimal Today surface and predefined logging actions.
- visionOS (`Apps/RipplevisionOS/VisionRootView.swift`): windowed navigation with ornaments and shared feature screens.

### Screen and sheet documentation contract

The shared catalog gives every surface exactly one canonical,
platform-independent description file under [`screens/`](screens/). For
example, [`screens/today.md`](screens/today.md) owns the Today layout and
function, while [`screens/history.md`](screens/history.md) owns the History
list/calendar behavior. Those files are the semantic source of truth for
layout, actions, states, accessibility, and responsive behavior.

This iOS document maps each canonical description to the native implementation
entry points currently present in the repository. It does **not** require one
Swift file per screen or sheet. SwiftUI views, view models, chart marks, token
definitions, platform roots, and private helpers may be split or co-located
according to feature boundaries and native architecture. A source layout
change is an implementation refactor, not a change to the shared surface
contract.

### iOS surface implementation map

The left column is the stable ID from the shared catalog. “Implementation
entry point(s)” is the source map verified in this repository. Paths are
repository-relative; the canonical description is linked separately.

| Surface ID | Canonical description | Implementation entry point(s) | Owning feature/use-case boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `today` | [`screens/today.md`](screens/today.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Today/TodayView.swift` | `TodayViewModel`; `ObserveToday`, `LogIntake`, `UndoLastIntake`. |

| `edit-intake` | [`screens/edit-intake.md`](screens/edit-intake.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/History/EditIntakeSheet.swift` | `EditIntake`; no new-log shortcut. |
| `stats` | [`screens/stats.md`](screens/stats.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Stats/StatsView.swift` | `StatsViewModel`; `ObserveStats`; chart marks may remain private or separately owned primitives. |
| `settings` | [`screens/settings.md`](screens/settings.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Settings/SettingsView.swift` | `SettingsViewModel`; profile, goal, container, reminder, sync, permission, export operations. |
| `add-container` | [`screens/add-container.md`](screens/add-container.md) | Private `ContainerEditorSheet` in `SettingsView.swift` | Local draft; `UpsertContainer`. |
| `edit-container` | [`screens/edit-container.md`](screens/edit-container.md) | Private `ContainerEditorSheet` in `SettingsView.swift` | Existing ID draft; `UpsertContainer`, `DeleteContainer`. |
| `edit-reminder` | [`screens/edit-reminder.md`](screens/edit-reminder.md) | Private `ReminderEditorSheet` in `SettingsView.swift` | Local rule draft; `RescheduleReminders`. |
| `onboarding` | [`screens/onboarding.md`](screens/onboarding.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift`; `OnboardingPages.swift` is support | `OnboardingViewModel`; profile/goal/permission use cases. |
| `watch-today` | [`screens/watch-today.md`](screens/watch-today.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Watch/WatchTodayView.swift` | `WatchTodayViewModel`; opens the amount sheet, observes Today, and exposes eligible Undo. |
| `watch-custom-amount` | [`screens/watch-custom-amount.md`](screens/watch-custom-amount.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Watch/WatchCustomAmountView.swift` | `WatchAmountSelection`; `LogIntake` with source `watch`. |
| `watch-history` | [`screens/watch-history.md`](screens/watch-history.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Watch/WatchHistoryView.swift` | `WatchHistoryViewModel`; recent-seven-day observation. |
| `watch-day-detail` | [`screens/watch-day-detail.md`](screens/watch-day-detail.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Watch/WatchDayDetailView.swift` | `WatchDayDetailViewModel`; soft-delete/restore. |
| `watch-stats` | [`screens/watch-stats.md`](screens/watch-stats.md) | `Packages/RippleFeatures/Sources/RippleFeatures/Watch/WatchStatsView.swift` | `WatchStatsViewModel`; current ISO-week `ObserveStats`. |

| `quick-log-control` | [`screens/quick-log-control.md`](screens/quick-log-control.md) | `Extensions/RippleWidgets/LogWaterControl.swift` | App/control adapter; shared `LogIntake`. |
| `shortcuts-and-intents` | [`screens/shortcuts-and-intents.md`](screens/shortcuts-and-intents.md) | `Packages/RippleIntentsCore/Sources/RippleIntentsCore/LogWaterIntent.swift` and related intent files | `RippleIntentsCore`; no second amount logic. |
| `notification-actions` | [`screens/notification-actions.md`](screens/notification-actions.md) | `Packages/RippleData/Sources/RippleData/Notifications/NotificationAuthorizer.swift` and scheduler/action wiring | `RippleData` adapter; shared `LogIntake`. |
| `complication` | [`screens/complication.md`](screens/complication.md) | `Extensions/RippleWatchWidgets/` family files | Snapshot projection; no calendar/Stats chart. |
| `share-export` | [`screens/share-export.md`](screens/share-export.md) | Native platform share/export composition from `ExportData` | `ExportData`; no mutation. |

The Settings editor sheets remain co-located in the current repository. That
fact is an implementation note only; their canonical layout and function are
already independent files under `Docs/shared/screens/`, and the shared
contract does not require a later source split.

### iOS composition-root routing overlay

The surface implementation table above identifies the feature entry points.
The following overlay identifies the additional iOS composition-root ownership
introduced by `RippleNavigationCoordinator`; it does not move feature ownership
or turn the route state into a shared product contract.

| Shared surface(s) | Coordinator state | `RootView` wiring | Feature seam and result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `today`, `history`, `stats`, `settings` | `selectedSection` and `open(Route)` | Binds the four root selections to the iOS tab shell; consumes pending `RippleRoute` requests when the scene becomes active. | Feature views keep their own read models and use cases; selecting a root changes presentation context only. |
| `history`, `day-detail` | `historyPath` and `Destination.historyDay` | Compact History supplies `onOpenDay`; the typed destination renders `DayDetailView` from the iOS root. | The History feature continues to own calendar selection and the expanded split detail pane; compact navigation preserves the selected date. |
| `today`, `history`, `custom-amount` | `presentedSheet` and `historyDetailRefreshID` | Today and History receive `onPresentCustomAmount`; the root presents `CustomAmountSheet` and increments the refresh identity after dismissal before refreshing Today and History. | The sheet still owns draft validation and calls `LogIntake`; presentation ownership does not add a second write path. |
| `settings`, `add-container`, `edit-container`, `edit-reminder` | `settingsPresentation: SettingsRoute?` | The root binds the route into `SettingsView`; Settings renders the appropriate editor sheet and returns through the binding. | `SettingsViewModel` remains the owner of profile/container/reminder operations; the coordinator only selects the Settings root and presentation route. |

This overlay is intentionally iOS-only. watchOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and
Android retain their native root and nested navigation models while mapping the
same canonical surface contracts.

### RippleUI component ownership manifest

Every custom element referenced by a feature has one owning file in `RippleUI`.
Feature screens may compose it and supply domain values; they may not copy its
visual implementation.

| Design-system element | iOS owner |
|---|---|
| `GlassCard`, `GlassCardRow` | `Packages/RippleUI/Sources/RippleUI/Components/GlassCard.swift`, `GlassCardRow.swift` |
| `LogButton`, `QuickAddCluster` | `Components/LogButton.swift`, `Components/QuickAddCluster.swift` |
| `ContainerChip`, `ContainerSymbolPicker`, `AmountStepper` | `Components/ContainerChip.swift`, `ContainerSymbolPicker.swift`, `AmountStepper.swift` |
| `DayHeader`, `RemainingLabel`, `IntakeRow` | `Components/DayHeader.swift`, `RemainingLabel.swift`, `IntakeRow.swift` |
| `SyncStatusView`, `EmptyState`, `RippleToast`, `DayRing` | `Components/SyncStatusView.swift`, `EmptyState.swift`, `RippleToast.swift`, `DayRing.swift` |
| `GlassShape`, `WaterFill`, `PourStreamShape`, `GlassReadout`, `RippleHeroView` | `Hero/GlassShape.swift`, `Hero/WaterFill.swift`, `Hero/PourStream.swift`, `Hero/GlassReadout.swift`, `Hero/RippleHeroView.swift` |
| Watch water/log/action/chart primitives | `Components/WatchWaterBackdrop.swift`, `WatchLogButton.swift`, `WatchQuickAmountRow.swift`, `WatchDayRow.swift`, `WatchStatChart.swift` |
| Widget glass | `Components/WidgetGlass.swift` |

Token definitions remain in `RippleUI/Tokens`; hero motion algorithms remain in
`RippleUI/Hero`/`Motion`. A feature-specific chart mark or navigation ornament
may remain in its feature/app file only when it is not a reusable RippleUI
element and its styling consumes the shared tokens.

### Native SwiftUI mapping policy

The iOS implementation expresses the semantic catalog with native SwiftUI
controls and navigation where possible:

| Shared behavior | Native iOS expression | Ripple responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Four app roots | `TabView` in the iPhone root; platform-local split/sidebar roots on larger Apple devices | Preserve four root meanings and no back button on root tabs. |
| Child navigation | Typed `NavigationStack` paths and split navigation owned by the iOS root, with narrow feature bindings/actions | Keep History → Day Detail relationship and selected-date context while preserving native iPad split behavior. |
| Grouped settings/content | `Form`, `List`, or `GlassCard` composition | Use `RippleUI` tokens/components; views do not write SwiftData. |
| Text entry | Native `TextField`/text editor | Draft validation, localized labels, integer-ml conversion. |
| Amount selection | Native `Slider` for Custom Amount and container editor; `AmountStepper` only where explicitly required | Range 50–2,000 ml, step 10, unit-aware value and accessibility. |
| Boolean setting | Native `Toggle` | One-default invariant and permission/settings use case. |
| Choice/mode/period | Native picker/menu/segmented control | Localized options and read/use-case update. |
| Presented sheet | Native sheet presentation with platform detents/drag affordance; iOS root state may bind into a feature surface | One canonical surface description, an appropriate owning feature boundary, explicit cancel/save, and no accidental mutation. |
| Destructive action | Native alert/confirmation dialog or platform gesture confirmation | Soft delete, consequence copy, undo/restore semantics. |
| Reorder | SDK 27 reorder API where supported by the target | Persist normalized `sort` through `UpsertContainer`; tvOS uses its documented platform boundary. |
| Share/permissions | Native system share and permission surfaces | Pre-explanation, adapter result, no impersonation of OS UI. |

`RippleUI` supplies colors, typography, spacing, shapes, motion, custom hero
geometry, cards, chips, toast, and accessibility wrappers. Native controls keep
their Apple-standard focus, keyboard, pointer, VoiceOver, dismissal, and hit
target behavior. `#if os()` is allowed only in apps, UI adapters, and
composition roots; it must not select different domain rules in a view model.

## 10. UI system and motion

`RippleUI` owns the visual language used by all features:

- water deep, lagoon, aqua, foam, success, and danger color tokens;
- San Francisco text styles and monospaced digits;
- 4-point spacing, 12-point control radius, 20-point card radius, and 28-point hero radius;
- glass cards, controls, day rings, intake rows, empty states, remaining labels, and sync status;
- Liquid Glass-compatible control styling with platform-appropriate fallbacks;
- widget and Watch-specific metrics and components.

Features compose these components; they do not copy token values or create local design systems.

### Today hero

The hero is a stylized 2D glass field, not a circular progress view. `RippleHeroView` receives a snapshot and a motion phase, while `WaterFill`, `PourStreamShape`, and the surface geometry remain presentation-only.

The implementation follows the authoritative motion specification:

- idle water is flat and has no sine loop or `TimelineView` animation;
- level zero contains no fill and no bottom shimmer;
- one active stream represents a coalesced add series;
- stream width and duration are derived from the series amount;
- the stream starts above the glass, establishes to the water surface, and fades from the shared pour clock;
- the level rises linearly and reaches its target exactly when the stream disappears;
- the contact response is a central depression, an outward pair, a weaker reflection, and a settle to flat water;
- screen-aligned Core Motion tilt drives damped, area-preserving slosh on physical iOS only;
- Simulator, Mac, Watch, widgets, face-up states, and Reduce Motion use zero tilt;
- Reduce Motion removes the stream and surface reaction and uses the specified cross-fade.

The geometry keeps water contained even under full rotation. It is a bounded 2D shape calculation, not a particle, SPH, Metal, SpriteKit, Lottie, or video simulation.

## 11. Platform and extension architecture

| Target | Composition root | Shared behavior | Platform-specific behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iOS/iPadOS | `Apps/RippleiOS` | Full Today, History, Stats, Settings, onboarding, intents, HealthKit | Tabs on iPhone; split layouts on iPad; Core Motion hero tilt on physical iOS |
| watchOS | `Apps/RipplewatchOS` | Same domain/store/use cases | Watch-native pages, Crown amount entry, recent seven-day history, current ISO-week stats, OLED presentation |
| iOS widgets | `Extensions/RippleWidgets` | Shared store/read models and `LogWidgetWaterIntent` | Static focused surfaces; no pour stream, surface response, or tilt |
| Watch widgets | `Extensions/RippleWatchWidgets` | Shared store/read models and widget intent | Circular, rectangular, and inline complication families |
| macOS | `Apps/RipplemacOS` | Shared Today/History/Stats/Settings features | Sidebar, ⌘N logging, ⌘Z undo, menu bar entry point |
| tvOS | `Apps/RippletvOS` | Shared Today snapshot and logging use cases | Ambient/minimal hero with large predefined buttons |
| visionOS | `Apps/RipplevisionOS` | Shared features and use cases | Windowed layout, navigation and logging ornaments, no immersive router |

All app and widget targets use the configured App Group and CloudKit identifiers where their entitlements support them. The current macOS entitlements file is empty, so Mac storage falls back according to `SharedContainer` until the Mac target is granted the same shared capabilities; cross-process/cross-device Mac sync must not be assumed from the target alone.

## 12. App Intents and system entry points

`RippleIntentsCore` contains the system contract, not a second domain implementation. The current intents include:

- logging a specified or default amount;
- logging from a widget with source `.widget`;
- undoing the last intake;
- reading today's progress;
- setting the daily goal;
- opening Today or History through the pending-route bridge;
- stable `ContainerEntity` lookup and App Shortcuts.

Amount resolution is centralized in the intent adapter and ends at `LogIntake`. Container entities use stable UUIDs and query the settings repository. Shortcut phrases and localized strings are declared with the app name so Siri and Shortcuts remain stable across locales.

`RippleNavigation` remains a narrow pending-route handoff for system requests.
The iOS composition root consumes it through `RippleNavigationCoordinator`,
which maps those requests into the app-wide iOS route state. The coordinator is
not shared with the other Apple app targets; each target retains its native
navigation model.

## 13. Concurrency model

The project uses Swift 6 and complete strict concurrency checking.

- Domain entities, snapshots, ports, and use-case values are Sendable where they cross boundaries.
- SwiftData access is isolated to `RippleStore`, a `@ModelActor` actor.
- View models are Main Actor isolated because they own observable UI state.
- HealthKit and sync helpers use actors where system access or mutable projection state requires serialization.
- Asynchronous tasks are launched from view models for refreshes, debounced/coalesced motion, and authorization flows; cancellation and stale-series guards prevent old work from updating current UI state.
- The shared `UseCases` value is assembled once per process and passed explicitly to consumers.

This separation prevents a model context, a SwiftUI observation object, or a platform framework client from leaking through the domain API.

## 14. Localization, accessibility, and presentation rules

Ripple v1 supports German and English. Feature copy is localized through the package resource bundle and `String(localized:)`; English strings are not hard-coded as a substitute for German localization.

The presentation layer must preserve:

- Dynamic Type through XXXL;
- complete VoiceOver labels containing amount, goal, percentage, and source where relevant;
- monospaced digits for changing numeric readouts;
- readable Deep-on-Foam contrast in light mode and cool anthracite surfaces in dark mode;
- reduced-motion behavior for all active hero and control motion;
- platform-native navigation semantics and no back button on tab roots.

## 15. Testing and verification

Tests are kept close to the package that owns the rule:

- `RippleDomain`: logging/undo, goal formula, units, authorization use cases, history/stats, and pacing.
- `RippleData`: SwiftData store behavior and deterministic demo seeding.
- `RippleIntentsCore`: intent parameters, source attribution, and shared write-path behavior.
- `RippleFeatures`: Today, History, onboarding, Watch amount selection, Watch history, and Watch stats.
- `RippleUI`: hero timing/geometry, water dynamics, and Watch components.

The most important invariants to preserve in new tests are:

- one store row per user log;
- every log source reaches `LogIntake`;
- HealthKit failure does not remove a saved intake;
- undo/delete are soft deletes and restore the same identity;
- zero level is visually empty;
- active pours have no level overshoot;
- Reduce Motion removes stream/surface reaction and tilt;
- future history days cannot be selected;
- chart data remains correct for empty, partial, over-goal, and multi-period states.

Package tests can be run with the repository's documented commands, for example:

```sh
swift test --package-path Packages/RippleDomain
swift test --package-path Packages/RippleData
swift test --package-path Packages/RippleIntentsCore
```

Application and widget targets are verified with Xcode builds/tests for their platform destinations.

## 16. Adding a feature without breaking the architecture

For a new behavior, follow this sequence:

1. Decide whether it changes product behavior. If it changes hero, History, or Stats behavior, update the matching authoritative specification first.
2. Add or extend a domain entity/value type and use case. Keep amounts in integer milliliters.
3. Add the smallest required port method rather than importing a framework into the domain.
4. Implement persistence or system access in `RippleData` behind the port and keep SwiftData access in `RippleStore`.
5. Add a Main Actor `@Observable` view model operation that calls the use case.
6. Build or extend a reusable token/component in `RippleUI` instead of defining feature-local styling.
7. Route Siri, widget, Watch, notification, or Control behavior through the existing use case.
8. Add unit tests for the use case and representative UI/platform tests for the new state.
9. Verify light/dark mode, Dynamic Type XXXL, Reduce Motion, empty/loading/error states, and localization.

Do not add a direct `ModelContext` to a view, a second intake writer, a UserDefaults source of truth, a cross-platform router, or a platform-specific copy of a domain rule. Extend `RippleNavigationCoordinator` for new iOS routes instead of creating a second router or singleton.

For a new iOS navigable surface or presentation:

- add the typed route, destination, or presentation state to
  `Apps/RippleiOS/RippleNavigationCoordinator.swift`;
- bind the state and destination rendering in `RootView`;
- expose only narrow `Binding` values or routing closures from
  `RippleFeatures` views, without importing the app target; and
- preserve each platform's native root shell when mapping the same shared
  surface to watchOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, or Android.

## 18. Documentation maintenance

This document is the iOS implementation reference included in the Android
port handoff. The Android project is independent and has its own `AGENTS.md`,
architecture document, and UI specification. Both projects consume the PRD;
Android may use this document to understand the source iOS boundaries, but its
implementation architecture is not a dependency of the Android project.

### Source-of-truth precedence

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. `AGENTS.md` for repository process, architecture boundaries, bans, and shared design constraints.
2. The authoritative product specification: [Ripple PRD](Ripple_PRD.md). Its detailed Today, History, Stats, and motion contracts are in Section 22.
3. The [screen catalog](Ripple_SCREEN_CATALOG.md), [design system](Ripple_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md), and [data model](Ripple_DATA_MODEL.md) for platform-independent surface, UI, and domain detail.
4. This document for iOS module boundaries, Swift implementation files, and Apple-platform workflows.
5. The implementation and tests, which reveal current behavior and must be brought back into agreement when they drift.

If a product decision changes, update the shared PRD. If an iOS architecture
decision changes, update this document. Android documentation is updated in
the independent Android project when Android-only behavior changes.

### Changes that require a documentation review

Review this document and the shared PRD whenever an iOS change affects:

- domain entities, value types, goal formulas, units, use cases, ports, or source attribution;
- persistence models, migrations, stores, sync/conflict behavior, soft deletion, export, or backup;
- HealthKit projection, authorization, notification scheduling, or background work;
- widgets, Watch surfaces, App Intents, shortcuts, or notification actions;
- package/module boundaries, composition roots, dependencies, deployment targets, or concurrency rules;
- Today hero behavior, motion, reduced motion, History, Stats, navigation, accessibility, or localization;
- platform scope, release requirements, security, privacy, or testing obligations.

If the shared product contract is unchanged, record the iOS-only nature in this
document's timeline entry.

### Required update workflow

1. Read this document, the shared PRD, and the affected source specification before editing iOS code or architecture.
2. Identify whether the change is shared, iOS-only, or a change to the product contract.
3. Update the relevant architecture sections in the same change as the implementation.
4. Update `Document version` and `Last verified` in every document that changed.
5. Append one immutable row to the changed document's timeline. New rows go at the bottom; historical rows are not rewritten or deleted.
6. If the shared product contract changed, update the PRD and record the corresponding timeline row; do not add Android implementation changes to this repository's architecture document.
7. If a UI or data contract changed, update the shared screen/design/data document and the Android UI handoff in the same change, even when no Android source changes.
8. Verify Markdown links, headings, code examples, and relevant tests/builds. A documentation-only correction still runs whitespace/link checks.
9. Commit the documentation with the implementation, or as a separate documentation commit when no code changed.

### Documentation versioning

Use semantic document versions independently from the app version:

- **MAJOR**: incompatible architecture, scope, data, or public contract change.
- **MINOR**: new capability, platform surface, module boundary, or normative requirement that remains compatible.
- **PATCH**: factual correction, wording clarification, link correction, formatting, or example update with no contract change.

The timeline is the audit trail. Each row records the document version, date, change, and impact. Do not combine unrelated changes into an unexplained version bump.

### Synchronized-document checklist

Before merging an architecture-affecting change, confirm:

- [ ] The source specification is updated when required.
- [ ] The iOS document reflects the current Swift implementation.
- [ ] Shared product behavior, units, sources, and feature names remain aligned with the PRD.
- [ ] iOS-specific UI/workflow behavior is intentional and documented.
- [ ] The new timeline entry is present and the version/date metadata is current.

## 18.1 Resizable iOS composition and active folds

The [Today](screens/today.md) and [History](screens/history.md) contracts use
local container geometry. `RootView` retains the four tabs and owns view-model
lifetimes through resizing. Layout inputs belong to views and `RippleUI`
adapters, never domain use cases or stored device-wide geometry. The existing
SwiftUI `App` / `WindowGroup` scene lifecycle remains in place.

Use the design-system thresholds for expanded presentation and History split
independently. Today measures its padded content region, scales the hero
within existing maxima, and provides vertical overflow for short windows.
History retains selected-day navigation and presents custom entry from a
stable owner outside the changing compact/split branches.

On iOS 27.1 and later, the active-fold path uses native `ArrangementView` for
Today hero/actions and History calendar/detail. Keep availability checks for
the iOS 27.0 minimum and ordinary adaptive containers where no fold is active.
Stats, Settings, onboarding, and sheets retain native standard containers.
Native safe-area handling owns asymmetric regions; no global screen or device
idiom lookup and no inferred hinge inset belongs in a feature. The scene-local
interface orientation in `GravityTiltController` remains necessary for physical
Core Motion reference rotation and is not an available-space decision.

Stats and Settings keep their native ScrollView containers across those
regions. Their feature-local content uses the shared adaptive panel minimum:
wide containers form readable chart/group columns, while compact containers
stack in semantic order; Stats summary tiles use the shared centered width cap.

This mapping introduces no data, permission, amount, or motion behavior. Runtime
acceptance must cover compact/expanded transitions, an open day detail and
custom amount draft, a short window, large text, and Reduce Motion. Wireframes
are documentation illustrations and do not constitute that runtime evidence.

## 19. Timeline

Newest entries are appended at the bottom. Historical entries are immutable.

| Version | Date | Change | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-09-07 | Initial complete Swift/SwiftUI architecture document created from the repository specifications and implementation. | Establishes the iOS layering, persistence, use-case, platform, UI, motion, and testing baseline. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-09-07 | Added the paired-document maintenance contract, semantic document versioning, synchronized-document checklist, and immutable timeline. | Architecture changes now require an explicit documentation review and versioned audit entry. |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-09-07 | Moved the iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS root SwiftUI shells into their executable app targets; `RippleFeatures` now contains reusable feature screens and view models only. | Platform-specific root APIs are compiled only by their owning Apple target. The Android companion contract is unaffected because this is an Apple repository-boundary refactor with no shared product or domain change. |
| 1.3.0 | 2026-09-08 | Synchronized the shared architecture record with the current four-root iOS product hierarchy, no-Recent Today surface, six-page onboarding, Day Detail flow, and the v2 Android UI companion; no Swift architecture or runtime code changed. | Keeps the Apple architecture and Android companion aligned on shared screens, flows, and use-case semantics while preserving platform-local presentation. |
| 1.3.1 | 2026-09-08 | Updated the Android companion links after consolidating Android product documentation under `Docs/Android/`; no shared architecture or runtime behavior changed. | The paired architecture documents remain discoverable while the Android contract has one product-docs root. |
| 1.3.2 | 2026-09-08 | Moved the maintained product specifications and reference captures from the ignored handoff directory into `Docs/Product/`; updated the architecture links. | Product contracts are now tracked with the rest of the maintained documentation, while agent-generated task records remain separate and ignored. |
| 1.3.3 | 2026-09-08 | Consolidated the Today, History, Stats, and motion specifications into the single versioned `Docs/Product/Ripple_PRD.md`; no Swift architecture or runtime behavior changed. | The architecture document now points to one product source of truth while retaining platform-local implementation boundaries. |
| 1.4.0 | 2026-09-08 | Removed the ADR document tree and made the PRD plus this architecture document the maintained shared contracts; updated the repository layout and maintenance workflow. | Fewer maintained files are required, with product behavior versioned in the PRD and implementation boundaries versioned here. |
| 1.5.0 | 2026-09-08 | Clarified that this is the iOS-only architecture document and moved the shared PRD/reference material to `Docs/shared/`; removed the Android companion dependency. | The independent iOS and Android projects now share only the product contract and reference material, while each project owns its implementation architecture and agent instructions. |
| 1.5.1 | 2026-09-08 | Included the iOS architecture reference in the complete Android port handoff under `Docs/shared/` and corrected its relative links. | Android agents can inspect the source iOS boundaries without treating the iOS implementation as an Android dependency. |
| 1.6.0 | 2026-09-10 | Raised every Apple deployment target to 27.0 and removed the older-runtime availability branch from the SDK 27 container reorder implementation; tvOS remains excluded because `.reorderable()` is unavailable there. | The Apple targets share one SDK 27 baseline, so supported platforms can use the native reorder API directly while the existing tvOS platform boundary remains explicit. |
| 1.7.0 | 2026-09-11 | Added links to the shared screen catalog, design system, and data model; made the one-screen-or-sheet-per-file rule explicit; added current/target iOS surface and RippleUI ownership manifests plus native-control mappings. | iOS implementation files can be mapped one-to-one to shared surface IDs while current Settings sheet co-location remains honestly documented as a migration target. |
| 1.8.0 | 2026-09-11 | Corrected the surface ownership contract: each screen and sheet now has one canonical platform-independent description file, while iOS source files may be split or co-located according to native feature architecture. Replaced the target one-file manifest with a canonical-description-to-implementation map. | The iOS implementation remains traceable to every shared surface without imposing a production source-file structure that was not requested. |
| 1.9.0 | 2026-09-18 | Verified the implementation map and notification adapter against the Apple 1.1 release baseline; documented the current permission-aware, replaceable-next-reminder behavior without changing the Swift package boundaries. | The Android handoff can mirror the observable reminder contract while keeping scheduling platform-local and all logging on the shared domain use case. |
| 1.10.0 | 2026-09-19 | Mapped container-based Today/History reflow and iOS 27.1 native active-fold arrangement to the existing view/UI boundaries. | Four tabs, scene lifecycle, selection, and entry drafts survive resize; domain and motion remain unchanged. |
| 1.10.1 | 2026-09-20 | Mapped the shared adaptive panel and Stats summary tokens to StatsView and SettingsView while keeping native scroll containers and the system TabView rail. | iPhone Duo and iPad use readable multi-column analysis/settings regions without device-specific branches or new feature state. |
| 1.10.2 | 2026-09-23 | Mapped Wear Today to the single amount-sheet entry point and kept `LogIntake(source: watch)` on the explicit confirmation surface. | The iOS implementation map now matches the PRD and canonical Watch Today/custom-amount contracts without implying an immediate root-screen write. |
| 1.11.0 | 2026-09-24 | Added the iOS-only `RippleNavigationCoordinator` for root-section selection and pending App Intent route consumption while keeping feature-local child navigation and sheets local. | Root navigation now has an explicit observable owner and `OpenTodayIntent`/`OpenHistoryIntent` can select the requested section without introducing a cross-platform router. |
| 1.12.0 | 2026-09-24 | Expanded `RippleNavigationCoordinator` into the iOS app-wide typed router for root sections, compact History → Day Detail, custom-amount presentation, and Settings presentation routes; feature views now receive narrow routing bindings/actions. | iOS navigation state has one composition-root owner without coupling `RippleFeatures` to the app target or changing native navigation ownership on the other Apple platforms. |
| 1.12.1 | 2026-09-24 | Updated the iOS contribution workflow and implementation checklist to extend `RippleNavigationCoordinator` for new iOS routes while explicitly banning only cross-platform or duplicate router abstractions. | Future iOS navigation work has one documented composition-root entry point and cannot accidentally introduce a second router or app-target dependency into `RippleFeatures`. |
| 1.13.0 | 2026-09-24 | Added a verified composition-root routing overlay to the surface implementation map, covering root selection, compact History → Day Detail, root-owned Custom Amount presentation/refresh, and Settings editor presentation. | The iOS handoff now shows how the latest route owner surrounds each feature surface without confusing platform-specific routing with shared surface semantics or introducing a second write path. |

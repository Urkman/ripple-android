# Ripple visual reference inventory

**Document type:** Shared visual-reference audit and visible-element inventory
**Document version:** 1.0.3
**Last verified:** 2026-09-25
**Reference release baseline:** Apple marketing version 1.1 — 17 September 2026

This review note records which visual references were inspected for each stable
surface, how each reference is classified, which operating-system chrome is
excluded from the platform-independent wireframe, and which product-owned
elements must remain visible. It is linked from the canonical surface files and
does not replace the product, data, design, or platform contracts.

## Audit rules

- The PRD remains authoritative for product behavior, domain meaning, and
  motion. A capture can expose visible composition, but it cannot invent a
  behavior that the written contract does not define.
- **Current visual target** means the reference is the current composition to
  reconcile against. **Supporting evidence** means it helps verify hierarchy or
  a native platform expression. **Wireframe** means the shared neutral
  illustration that must preserve the documented product-owned structure.
- Differences between iOS and Android captures are classified as native chrome,
  platform expression, localization, seeded sample data, or viewport/crop. A
  product-owned region is not removed merely because one capture does not show
  it.
- Product-owned elements retain their documented order, grouping, repetition,
  and action meaning. Native presentation may change the control expression,
  but may not silently drop, merge, reorder, or recomposite those elements;
  such a change requires an update to the canonical surface contract.
- Status bars, device frames, system tab/navigation chrome, notification
  grouping, permission dialogs, share destinations, and host complication/widget
  placement are system-owned unless the surface contract explicitly assigns
  their content to Ripple. They are not required in a shared wireframe; the
  product-owned labels, values, actions, and state indicators inside them are.
- The shared wireframes are neutral illustrations, not runtime screenshots.
  Android/UI PNGs are authored layout illustrations, not emulator/device
  captures. Android runtime evidence is absent from this handoff and remains an
  explicit acceptance task in the independent Android project.

## Reference register

### Apple/iOS evidence

| Reference | Classification | State / viewport | Visible scope and limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`iphone-today.png`](screens/ios/iphone-today.png) | Current visual target | Ready, compact iPhone | Full Today product hierarchy; status bar and four-tab root chrome are native/platform presentation. |
| [`iphone-duo-today-outer.png`](screens/ios/iphone-duo-today-outer.png) | Current visual target | Zero/ready, compact outer display | Current fold/outer-display evidence; connectivity indicator and vertical root navigation are system/platform presentation. |
| [`iphone-history.png`](screens/ios/iphone-history.png) | Current visual target | Populated month, compact iPhone | Month grid and today-only add affordance; bottom root navigation and status bar are native chrome. |
| [`iphone-stats.png`](screens/ios/iphone-stats.png) | Supporting evidence | Week, compact iPhone, vertically cropped | Period selector, summaries, and first chart regions are visible; the crop does not remove the four-chart requirement in the written contract. |
| [`ipad-settings.png`](screens/ios/ipad-settings.png) | Supporting evidence | Ready, expanded iPad, vertically cropped | Profile through sync are visible; export/about remain required from the written Settings contract even though the capture ends before them. |
| [`watch-today.png`](screens/ios/watch-today.png) | Current visual target | Ready, wearable | Full-canvas water field, readout, and one Apple Watch add action; time/page indicators are platform chrome. |
| [`watch-history.png`](screens/ios/watch-history.png) | Supporting evidence | Recent history, wearable, cropped | Three rows are visible in the crop; the shared contract still requires seven elapsed local days and a continuation/scroll affordance. |
| [`watch-stats.png`](screens/ios/watch-stats.png) | Current visual target | Current ISO week, wearable, cropped | Week context, three summaries, and one compact chart; time/page indicators are platform chrome. |

### Android layout illustrations

The PNGs in [`Android/UI/README.md`](Android/UI/README.md) are authored Android
layout illustrations, not implementation evidence or runtime captures. They
are inspected here for visible product composition; native-control behavior is
defined in the Android UI specification.

| Reference | Classification | State / viewport | Visible scope and limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`phone-today.png`](Android/UI/phone-today.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Ready, compact phone | Hero fill matches the 62% readout; flat idle level, three ordered quick adds, custom amount, and root navigation; Android navigation is native chrome. |
| [`phone-history.png`](Android/UI/phone-history.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Populated September 2026, compact phone | All 30 dates fit in seven weekday columns; today is selected with its add action, future dates are disabled, and Android root navigation is native. |
| [`phone-day-detail.png`](Android/UI/phone-day-detail.png) | Supporting Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Ready, compact phone | Selected date, static summary, add action, three intake rows, and row actions. |
| [`phone-stats.png`](Android/UI/phone-stats.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Week, compact phone | Period and range context, three summary metrics, four distinct chart families, and separate Highlights. |
| [`phone-settings.png`](Android/UI/phone-settings.png) | Supporting Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Ready, compact phone | Profile, goal, containers, reminders/health, data, and about; native list/control rendering is platform-owned. |
| [`phone-onboarding.png`](Android/UI/phone-onboarding.png) | Supporting Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | First run, compact phone | Six-page sequence overview and Continue action; native permission surfaces are not pictured. |
| [`tablet-history-split.png`](Android/UI/tablet-history-split.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Expanded tablet, today selected | Complete seven-column month, disabled future dates, and selected-today detail with contained static glass, matching entry total, and today-only add; rail is native navigation. |
| [`tablet-stats.png`](Android/UI/tablet-stats.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Week, expanded tablet | Three summary metrics; actual-vs-goal, goal-rate, daypart, and container charts; separate Highlights. |
| [`wear-today.png`](Android/UI/wear-today.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Ready, wearable | Flat full-canvas level matches the 88% readout; complete goal context and one entry point to amount selection. |
| [`wear-history.png`](Android/UI/wear-history.png) | Supporting Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Seven-day history, wearable | Six rows are visible in the crop; the contract requires seven elapsed days and native scroll/paging for the remaining row. |
| [`wear-day-detail.png`](Android/UI/wear-day-detail.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Ready, wearable | Selected date, summary, rows with time/amount/container/source, row-level delete, and transient Undo. |
| [`wear-stats.png`](Android/UI/wear-stats.png) | Current Android layout illustration (not runtime evidence) | Current ISO week, wearable | Average/day, goal hits, total, and one compact chart; no period picker. |

## Surface inventories

Each section is the visual inventory for the linked canonical surface. The
wireframe column names the required shared image; platform-owned chrome is
listed separately so it is not mistaken for a missing product region.

## Reconciled differences and remaining gaps

- The shared and Android Stats illustrations preserve four separate
  chart-family regions and a dedicated Highlights region. The former Android
  chart groupings that omitted the container distribution have been replaced.
- The shared Settings wireframe now keeps Health, Sync, Export, and About as
  distinct product-owned groups even though the Android reference visually
  groups some rows. The platform mapping may group native rows only when it
  preserves those meanings and actions.
- The shared History wireframes now show the today-only add affordance. The
  adaptive overview remains a responsive composition diagram, not a runtime
  capture.
- The shared Wear History wireframe now represents all seven elapsed days and a
  continuation cue. The Apple and Android illustrations show fewer rows only because
  their visible crops/densities differ.
- Wear Today uses one `+` entry point; its amount sheet owns the three presets,
  rotary adjustment, and explicit confirmation. Wear Day Detail deletes one row
  immediately and exposes the documented short Undo action; neither surface
  permits an extra direct-write or edit path.
- Android resize/fold runtime evidence is still missing. The current iPhone Duo
  outer-display capture verifies only the pictured compact zero state; it does
  not prove live reflow, active-fold placement, or state retention.
- The former shared compact Today and Android phone Today illustrations used a
  generic rounded rectangle for the hero. The current iPhone Today capture and
  PRD §22.1 establish the tapered 2D tumbler as product-owned geometry; the
  former illustrations were therefore classified as incomplete and replaced.
  The still wireframes show the upright flat surface, while device-tilt slosh
  remains a behavioral contract rather than a static screenshot claim.

| 1.0.0 | 2026-09-23 | Added the evidence classification and visible-element inventory for all 22 stable surfaces; reconciled current captures, shared wireframes, and platform-owned chrome. | Documentation review can verify product-owned region order, density, repeated elements, chart structure, wearable continuation, and known evidence gaps without treating screenshots as a second product authority. |
| 1.0.1 | 2026-09-23 | Rebuilt Android Stats/Wear layout illustrations, reconciled wearable logging and delete flows to the PRD, and distinguished authored diagrams from runtime evidence. | Current reference mappings expose all required summary/chart content and preserve the separate Android runtime-acceptance gap. |
| 1.0.2 | 2026-09-23 | Replaced the clipped Android phone and tablet History illustrations with complete seven-column month views; aligned tablet Day Detail totals and corrected both wearable Today fill levels to match their readouts. | The Android visual audit now verifies complete calendar dates, today-only add, disabled future days, consistent split-detail values, and proportional wearable water without mistaking diagrams for runtime proof. |
| 1.0.3 | 2026-09-25 | Reconciled Today’s product-owned tapered tumbler silhouette and inner water containment against the current iPhone evidence and replaced the incomplete rounded-rectangle shared/Android hero illustrations; recorded upright/idle versus dynamic tilt behavior. | The Today visual inventory now checks the actual glass form and preserves the distinction between static wireframe composition and device-motion behavior. |
